so bascially in this image these are two different networks in a same organization,now the router is used because the thing is that it connects to the internet doesnt mean that it does it on its own now the main purpose of the router is to make communication betweeen two networks on the same organization allowing both of them to connect to the internet

so lets say if neeyorks marketing team wants to communicate with tokyo marketing so now it goes out with its default gateway and there is another gateway via which it goes the internet bascially a network of network connected by routers and goes back to it....



port numbers

Yes, you're absolutely right! A **port number** is used to identify a specific **process or service** on a server that should handle an incoming network message (data packet). It acts as a **logical identifier** for directing network traffic to the right application or service running on a server. Here's a more detailed explanation:

### 1. **Port as a Way to Identify Specific Process**

When a network message (e.g., a data packet) arrives at a server, the **port number** helps the operating system determine which **process** or **service** should handle the message. This is especially important when the server is running multiple services (like a web server, FTP server, database, etc.).

- **IP Address**: The server’s IP address identifies the machine in the network.
- **Port Number**: The port number identifies the specific service or process running on that machine.

Together, the **IP address** and **port number** form a **unique endpoint** for communication, which is often referred to as a **socket**. The operating system uses this **socket** to know which process should receive the incoming message.

### 2. **How Port Numbers Work in Network Communication**

Here’s how the system uses port numbers to forward network messages:

- **Step 1**: A client (e.g., your web browser) wants to connect to a server. The client will send a request to the server’s **IP address** and a **specific port number** (e.g., port 80 for HTTP).
    
- **Step 2**: The server, upon receiving the network message, looks at the **port number** in the message header.
    
    - If the message is intended for **port 80**, the server knows the request is for the **web server** (HTTP).
    - If the message is for **port 443**, it knows it's an **HTTPS** request.
    - If the message is for **port 21**, it knows it's an **FTP** request, and so on.
- **Step 3**: The server then forwards the network message to the appropriate **process** or **service** based on the port number.
    
    - For example, if a message arrives at **port 80**, it will be handled by the HTTP service (like Apache or Nginx).
    - If the message arrives at **port 22**, it will be handled by the **SSH server** process.

### 3. **Example: How a Web Server Uses Port 80**

- **Scenario**: A user wants to visit a website by typing `http://example.com`.
    - The browser sends an HTTP request to `example.com` on **port 80**.
    - The server at `example.com` listens on **port 80** and knows that the request is for the **web server**.
    - The web server processes the request, retrieves the HTML page, and sends the response back to the browser.

### 4. **Ports as Logical Endpoints**

Think of **ports** as **logical doors** on a server. Each door corresponds to a **different service** or **application**. When a network packet arrives at the server:

- The server uses the **port number** to decide **which door** to open.
- The process or service that "owns" the door (the service bound to that port) handles the request.

For example:

- **Port 80**: HTTP service (web traffic)
- **Port 443**: HTTPS service (secure web traffic)
- **Port 21**: FTP service (file transfers)
- **Port 25**: SMTP service (email sending)

### 5. **Process Communication with Ports**

When a process (service) starts on a server, it "binds" itself to a specific port. This means it listens for incoming network messages on that port. For example:

- A **web server** binds to **port 80** and listens for HTTP requests.
- A **SSH server** binds to **port 22** to accept remote login requests.

The operating system on the server ensures that the data is forwarded to the correct process based on the port number, much like a **post office** delivering mail to the right recipient based on the **address** (IP) and **postal code** (port number).

so this is a bus topology connecting cable ehich has a thicknet cable in which the device is connected first and there is a black spots around there so they would pierce it and connect it there

![[Pasted image 20241230212931.png]]

firewall

![[Pasted image 20241230214207.png]]

so based upon your usage or connectivity your firewall can be directly connected to the modem or it can be next to a switch i.e router connected to the modem
![[Pasted image 20241230215252.png]]
ethernet b/w ap and the switch basically the switch powers it up and configures it 



### 
there are two kinds of cards so in a modern router we use something called nim(network interface module) (isr 4321)and wic's(basically found cisco router 1841)
Workflow of Connecting to the Internet:

1. **Local Network (LAN)**:
    
    - Devices on the local network (e.g., PCs, servers) send data to the router.
2. **WAN Interface**:
    
    - The router's WIC or NIM connects to the ISP’s network using the appropriate WAN technology (DSL, T1/E1, etc.).
3. **Data Transmission**:
    
    - The WAN interface transmits data from the LAN to the WAN and vice versa, enabling internet access for local devices.
4. **Routing**:
    
    - The router uses the WAN interface to determine the best path for outgoing and incoming data packets.

---

### Summary:

These interface cards/modules are **essential components of routers** for connecting local networks to external networks, including the internet. WICs are typically older, simpler, and less capable, while NIMs are more modern and versatile, supporting a wide range of connectivity options and faster speeds.



so in packet tracer the ip address you are mentioning is going to be crucial for example you use the default gateway address to be something like 192.168.1.2 with subnet mask then 192.168.1.3 change the last part alone

SWITCHES
![[Pasted image 20250102211150.png]]
how do you access ios of  aswitch and configure it so basically you have a console cable with two ports com and another rj-45 (com-usb is used nowdays) use putty to configure it.


configuring switch for vlan

Switch> enable Switch# configure terminal Switch(config)# interface FastEthernet0/1 Switch(config-if)# switchport mode access Switch(config-if)# switchport access vlan 10 Switch(config-if)# end`

 switchport mode access Switch(config-if changes the switch mode to access and sets vlan 10 port or forwards the packets to this port
 `do show start`
so you have to configure the witch for the port for which is it connected to the router also meaning you have to give a trunk interface(im just not too sure abt this rn we will have a deep look in future)
trunk interface also passaage of multiple vlans

also we need to create sub interface for different vlans basically now the interface is gig/0/0 basically now i want to create a sub interface out of this so what i do is that i will just first

int gig 0/0.10 represents that it is creating a sub interface for a network
	and import is that encapsulation 1q
![[Pasted image 20250104153250.png]]basically do this with remaing vlans

and dont forget to do write... and you can always check it with do show and now job is to assign ip address dynamically that is not by manullay typing it so for that i use my router so in the cli in config mode type service dhcp
and also take the vlan and say ip dhcp pool Admin-pool
assign the network of that range we subnetted


![[Pasted image 20250104154421.png]]summary of what i did bascially today 

so i created soho 
and also did subnetting 
int that bascally i needed to create vlans so for that i want ot configure my switch basically so that i created a vlan with seprate so for creating vlans just the port is enough so you say just i want this port to be here thats it....so now next step is that you know trunking bascially the port connencted from switch to the router basicallly
so trunk it see for the commnads()....and in router first configure the router connection to switch and basically create diff interface from one interface i.e this interface starts from thsi and assign an default gateway through which that port can access the router...so now also do it fo r all networks and atlast dhcp configurations so in that basically you need to configure dhcp of ip address

so now learning about switch ports

trunk and access switchport modes 

port connecting two switches is called trunk port  access port is which i call that your end device gets connected.so basically trucnk is used to connect multiple switches so the command 
go to that interface and say that for this interface keep this for that is switch mode trunk and do wr why do wee need this?
so you know it! and this thing computer to switch is alreaday in access mode as there is no vlan to configure

![[Pasted image 20250108204812.png]]


![[Pasted image 20250108205238.png]]

there is a range comman in which you can specify abt how much ports you can configure it
int range fa0/1-2 so each port starts with 0/1-2 means
so normally devices in different vlans cannot communicate

a trunk port can transmit and receive traffic from multiple VLANs by tagging each frame with its VLAN ID using the **802.1Q standard**.

vlan pruning so basically it is used to block certain vlan port to access ,thus preventing some unneccary traffic from being circulated accross the network

now about dynamic routing (rip)

Routing information protocol(rip)

![[Pasted image 20250116202055.png]]
Routers in **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** perform dynamic routing to exchange information about the best paths to reach destinations in a network. RIP is a distance-vector routing protocol that uses **hop count** as its metric to determine the best route.

### Key Functions of Routers in RIP:

1. **Exchange Routing Information**:
    
    - Routers send **RIP updates** to neighboring routers at regular intervals (default: every 30 seconds).
    - These updates contain the router's routing table, which lists networks it can reach and the hop count to each network.
2. **Maintain Routing Tables**:
    
    - Each router maintains a routing table with entries for:
        - Destination networks.
        - Next-hop router to reach the destination.
        - Hop count (distance) to the destination.
    - The table is updated dynamically based on information received from neighbors.
3. **Path Selection**:
    
    - Routers use the **shortest path (minimum hop count)** to forward packets.
    - RIP supports a maximum hop count of **15**, and any route with 16 or more hops is considered unreachable.
4. **Periodic Updates**:
    
    - Routers broadcast their routing table periodically to their neighbors using UDP port **520**.
    - These updates help propagate route information throughout the network.
5. **Convergence**:
    
    - RIP routers work together to achieve a consistent view of the network after changes (e.g., link failure or topology updates).
6. **Prevent Loops**:
    
    - RIP uses techniques like **split horizon**, **route poisoning**, and **hold-down timers** to avoid routing loops.

### Example Scenario:

- If a router learns about a new network via RIP, it adds an entry in its routing table, updating the hop count and next-hop details.
- If a link to a destination fails, RIP updates are sent to inform other routers, and alternate paths (if available) are used.

RIP is simple and effective for small to medium-sized networks, though it has limitations in scalability and speed of convergence compared to modern protocols like OSPF or EIGRP.




how to configure ssh on routers???

project 2![[Pasted image 20250124192726.png]]





first thing in this project is that our routers are connected via sce cables and we should do enable something called clock rate find out which port is at that clock rate...

![[Pasted image 20250124195754.png]]
set the clock rate for the port which has clock symbol init

otherwise dont
